```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS to create a gradient background. However, if you are using an older version of Tailwind CSS, the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility might not be available.  This would result in the gradient not rendering correctly, or causing a build error depending on your configuration.
