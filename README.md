# Tailwind CSS Gradient Utility Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradients with older versions of the framework. The `bg-gradient-to-r` utility, while widely used, may not be supported in all versions. This leads to potential rendering issues or build errors if not addressed properly.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file contains code that utilizes the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility to create a gradient background. If your Tailwind CSS version doesn't support this utility, the gradient won't function correctly.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to address this by either updating your Tailwind CSS version or using an alternative approach to achieve the desired gradient effect.  This might involve using a fallback method or adjusting your Tailwind configuration to include newer utilities.

## Setup
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3.  Install dependencies (if required, check package.json for instructions).
4.  Run the application to observe the issue (bug.js) and then the solution (bugSolution.js).
